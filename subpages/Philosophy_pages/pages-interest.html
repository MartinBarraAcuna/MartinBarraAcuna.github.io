<h2>Online Resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:</strong> The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is one of the most valuable resources for those of us dedicated to philosophy. It includes entries of the most diverse nature. From the treatment of classic authors to contemporary philosophical problems such as dialetheism, possible worlds, metaethics, ontology of mathematics, computational philosophy, among many other things that remain as work for the reader to discover!</li>
<li><strong>PhilPapers: Online Research in Philosophy:</strong> Philpapers is a huge database of different philosophy papers in most relevant areas. Many of these papers are categorized according to the area they deal with.</li>
<li><strong>SEFA Philosophy Encyclopedia | SEFA:</strong> This encyclopedia is a recent project. And it is edited by the Spanish Society of Analytic Philosophy (SEFA). Among its objectives is to publish entries accessible to an audience with some training or curiosity that serve as an introduction to topics that are worked on in the Society.</li>
<li><strong>Open Logic Project Builds:</strong> The Open Logic Project is a set of educational resources on mathematical logic designed for a non-mathematically specialized audience, and is intended to be used in advanced logic courses, such as those taught in many philosophy departments. It is open source: you can download the code in LaTeX, you are free to modify it in any way and share your changes. In addition, it is collaborative: a team of people works on it using the GitHub platform, and contributions and comments are accepted. Some of the books they have at the moment are:
    <ul>
    <li>Sets, Logic, Computation: An Open Introduction to Metalogic</li>
    <li>Incompleteness and Computability: An Open Introduction to Gödel's Theorems</li>
    <li>Boxes and Diamonds: An Open Introduction to Modal Logic</li>
    <li>Set Theory: An Open Introduction Set Theory</li>
    <li>Intermediate Logic</li>
    <li>What If?: An Open Introduction to Non-Classical Logics</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>forall x: Calgary. An Introduction to Formal Logic:</strong> forall x: Calgary is a comprehensive textbook on formal logic. It covers key concepts such as the validity of arguments and logical consequence, the syntax of truth-functional propositional logic (TFL) and its semantics through truth tables, as well as the syntax of first-order logic (FOL) with identity, including first-order interpretations. It also teaches how to symbolize statements in English using TFL and FOL, and presents natural deduction systems in the Fitch style for both logics. In addition, it addresses advanced topics such as modal logic, functional completeness, and soundness. It includes exercises with solutions and is available in PDF format (for on-screen reading, printing, and a special version for dyslexics), HTML (with additional accessibility features), and source code in LaTeX. For those who wish to use it in teaching, the open-source system Carnap is recommended, which is compatible with the notation and proof systems of forall x: Calgary. You can explore sample exercises from the book at carnap.io. (There is also an obsolete and unsupported proof editor/checker for the proof system used, available at proofs.openlogicproject.org.) The book has been translated into German (forall x: Dortmund) and Portuguese (Para Todxs: Natal).</li>
