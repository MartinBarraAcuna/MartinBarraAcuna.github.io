        <h2>Purpose of this page</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this page is to make LaTeX more accessible for philosophy. In technical branches of philosophy—especially in philosophy of science, logic, metaphysics, and formal epistemology—the use of formal tools is essential. However, anyone who has attempted to write mathematical documents in word processors like Microsoft Word knows how tedious and cumbersome the process can be. <br>
            
            This is particularly true for logicians, who often struggle to format lengthy proofs properly. Word imposes significant limitations when handling specialized notation. For example, Fitch-style natural deduction is not natively supported, forcing users to insert images instead. This approach compromises both the document's aesthetics and readability, and in the worst cases, can cause formatting issues when multiple images are loaded. <br>
            
            Another common challenge in Word is cross-referencing. The software does not automatically number equations, meaning users must reference them manually. If an equation number changes, every related reference in the text must be updated by hand, making the process inefficient and error-prone. <br>

            But none of these things happen in LaTeX. LaTeX addresses these issues by providing a <b>dedicated typesetting system for mathematical notation</b>, automatically numbering equations and managing <b>cross-references</b>. It allows for the creation of complex logical proofs, including Fitch-style deductions, through specialized packages, eliminating the need for cumbersome image insertions. This ensures <b>consistent formatting</b>, readability, and efficient document management, making it ideal for the precision required in philosophical works.

        <h2>Explanation of sections</h2>
        This page is far from covering everything you need to learn LaTeX. However, I have made an effort to organize it in such a way that it is easy to understand and allows you to acquire the basic knowledge of this language. The following explains the sections of the navigation bar
        <ul>
            <li>What is LaTeX</li>

            <p>It is explained what is LaTeX, some reasons for use it, some advantages and some disadvantages</p>

            <li>Basics</li>
            <p>Here is explained how configure a LaTeX document</p>

            <li>Packages</li>
            <p>Packages are the heart of a LaTeX document. In these section i present and explain main packages in LaTeX and some useful for philosophy</p>
            
            <li>Tools</li>
            <p>Since I Can not cover all features of LaTeX, I redirect the reader to material that will allow them to continue learning, in addition to presenting some tools that will make the job easier.</p>
        </ul>

I suggest understand this page as a tour. Then it is best to start in order with each of these sections (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4) <br> <br>
